_These are my notes for a talk i did the first time on an internal event on 2020-03-11, you can find the slides here: [slides.com/vjustov/redux-sagas](https://slides.com/vjustov/redux-sagas/)_


<!-- Purpose: Demistify how Redux-sagas works by diving deep into the inner workings of the library. -->
<!--
  Audience:
      TLDR: A junior developer who just got hired into a a startup that is using the library. He is struggling to understand why we are using it and what benefits it provides.
      Longer version: A more experience developer that has been working with the library and wants to understand what is going on behind the scenes.

<!-- Delivery: Blogpost walk through or talk -->
