author: Viktor Justo Vasquez, Vineeth Venudasan
purpose: Annotations are making us create less testable code, exploding dependencies, and write more complex tests
audience: Developers that have been using annotations for a long time.

~~We start this tale, with a story: "Add a retry mechanism to call XYZ", the approach that the team wanted to take was to just use the `@Retry` annotation from Spring Framework. should be as easy as adding the annotation on top of the method signature.~~

When we started writing the test to accomplish this, we started simple `@Autowire` this, write the test. run the test. Then:

```
Error creating bean with name '' [...] No qualifying bean of type ''
```

This is where our journey begins. Annotations provide a lot of different ways to "configure" Entity mapping, defining REST endpoints, validation, JSON mapping. Itâ€™s definitely convenient to rapidly bootstrap a project and makes writing code slightly faster.


Lets say for the sake of this story, that you have a service, this service calls a repository, this repository in turn calls another service that calls another repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
ARepository --> ZService
ZService --> BRepository
@enduml
```


```plantuml
@startuml
hexagon Services {
  hexagon Repositories {
    usecase ARepository
    usecase BRepository
  }
  usecase ZService
}


ARepository --> ZService
ZService --> BRepository


@enduml
```


```plantuml
@startuml
rectangle Repository {
  rectangle RestTemplate
}
cloud SomeServer

RestTemplate -> SomeServer


@enduml
```

These repositories make request to some endpoint far away
so they would have


Generally speaking we want to mock dependencies that cross the boundary between layers.
