We start this tale, with a story: "Add a retry mechanism to call XYZ", the approach that the team wanted to take was to just use the `@Retry` annotation from Spring Framework. should be as easy as adding the annotation on top of the method signature.

When we started writing the test to accomplish this, we started simple `@Autowire` this, write the test. run the test. Then:

```
Error creating bean with name '' [...] No qualifying bean of type ''
```

This is where we start our journey begins. Annotations provide a lot of different ways to "configure" Entity mapping, defining REST endpoints, validation, JSON mapping. Itâ€™s definitely convenient to rapidly bootstrap a project and makes writing code slightly faster.


Lets say for the sake of a story, that you have a service, this service calls a repository, this repository in turn calls another service that calls another repository.

```plantuml
@startuml
VDMRepository --> OExchangeService
OExchangeService --> MRepository
@enduml
```

These repositories make request to some endpoint far away
so they would have
