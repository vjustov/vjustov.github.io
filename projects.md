Here you will find some of the stuff that i am (or did in the past) currently working on:
- [Nulldrifter](https://nulldrifter.vjustov.me): A (Really Naive) React.js implementation of Magic: The gathering.
- [Altered.at](https://altered.at): A simple website for the community around altering MTG, pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh (playing) cards
- [Grunt-Sinatra](https://github.com/vjustov/grunt-sinatra): Grunt plugin to control your sinatra server.
- [ppt_hero](/ppt_hero): This is a job application that I sent to join [Pixel Perfect Tree](https://pixelpt.com/) back in 2014. For some reason I thought it would be a good idea to put this here in 2020. (Because i just moved this here and didn't, change anything about it, the routing isn't working)

### I have also made some contributions to:
- [Sugar](https://github.com/sugar-framework/sugar): a Modular web framework for Elixir
- [kiiboh Configurator](https://github.com/kiibohd/configurator/):
